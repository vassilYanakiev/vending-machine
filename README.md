# Task

We would like to ask you to implement a vending machine with the following requirements:
-	Inventory size – up to 15 products of the same type
-	Price of products – should be different for each type
-	Use a currency of your choice, but please note the accepted coin denominations in a readme file. Make sure your vending machine accepts only the selected denominations
-	The machine must return change
-	Web Design: responsive
Operations to be implemented:
-	Products - Get initial products list data from external resource (mocked API created by you)
